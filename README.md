# Calculator v1.1


## About

A browser version of simple calculator with basic functions.


## New in v1.1

### Features / Improvements:

- **Partial chaining operations:** Pressing an operator after an operation automatically uses the previous result for the next calculation.
- **Decimal handling fixes:** Fixed issues with multiple decimal points per operand and operator entry immediately after a decimal.
- **Keyboard support:** Use number keys, operators (+, -, *, /, %), dot (.), Enter (=), Backspace, and Shift+R (reset).


## Features 

- A display that shows operands, the operator, and the result simultaneously.
- Buttons include: 
   - Numbers (0 - 9).
   - Operators (+, -, ×, ÷, REM). 
   - Decimal dot (.).
   - Reset (AC) and backspace (⌫).
   - Paranthesis (currently disabled).
- Decimal dot works only once per operand.
- Pressing = gives the result; the result can be used in further calculations.
- Pressing a number after a result resets the calculator automatically.
- Reset (AC) clears all.
- Backspace (⌫) removes a single digit or operator; clears display if empty.


## Note 

- Paranthesis buttons are currently disabled, and will be enabled in future.
- There's space for second display under main display which will be used in future.
- Keyboard support will be added soon.
