- Buttons include: 
   - Number buttons (0 - 9).
   - Operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷, REM). 
   - Decimal dot button.
   - Reset button (AC) and backspace (⌫) button.
   - Paranthesis buttons (currently disabled).

## How it works?
 
- User need to provide pair of operands and operator in between by clicking appropriate buttons available.
- Decimal-dot (.) only works once per operand.
- Pressing equal-to (=) provides result of the operation.
- Result of the operation is taken as next operand for further calculation, unless user enters a number on which calculator will be reset to 0. 
- Pressing AC manually resets the calculator.
- Pressing backspace (⌫) removes a single digit or operator at a time, and calculator resets if all the characters are removed.

- There's space for second display under main display which will be used in future.
